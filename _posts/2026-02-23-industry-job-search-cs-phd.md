I recently wrapped up my ML PhD industry job search and experienced firsthand how stressful and overwhelming the process can be. While it's still fresh, I wanted to share what I learned along the way in hopes it might help others navigating the same journey.


I break this into two parts. **Part 1** covers the end-to-end process: the first thing I did from a "let's graduate" conversation with my advisor, getting my foot in the door, prepping for different interviews, dealing with rejection, and choosing between offers. **Part 2** covers some things I learned the hard way: bouncing back after a bad interview, surviving back-to-back interviews, and how having a support system keeps me sane.

# Part 1: Job search end-to-end
Last Fall I was in the first half of my 5th year, just wrapping up an internship where I realized I can now drive and own a project end to end; some stuff I learned during my internship even inspired me to kick off another project in my PhD. Really back then I was still comfortable being a PhD student. Suddenly my advisor brings up graduating next spring.

It all feels overwhelming at once. How do I even start? With PhD research projects still ongoing too, it's very tempting to procrastinate, but I eventually realized my advisor brought up graduation for a reason. I was indeed ready for independent research and carve my path outside of the lab. So what was the first step?
