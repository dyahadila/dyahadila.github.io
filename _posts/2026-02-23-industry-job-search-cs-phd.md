I recently wrapped up my ML PhD industry job search (research scientist position) and experienced how stressful and overwhelming the process can be. While it's still fresh, I wanted to share what I learned along the way in hopes it might help others navigating the same journey.


I break this into two parts. **Part 1** covers the end-to-end process: the first thing I did from a "let's graduate" conversation with my advisor, getting my foot in the door, prepping for different interviews, dealing with rejection, and choosing between offers. **Part 2** covers some things I learned along the way: bouncing back after a bad interview, surviving back-to-back interviews, and how having a support system keeps me sane.

# Part 1: Job search end-to-end
Last Fall I was in the first half of my 5th year, just wrapping up an internship and was excited to get back to school to kick off some new PhD projects. Back then I was still comfortable being a PhD student where I can freely explore even the most unhinged curiosities. Suddenly my advisor brings up graduating next spring.

It all feels overwhelming. How do I even start? With PhD research projects still ongoing, it was very tempting to procrastinate (and I did, for a while). But I eventually realized my advisor brought up graduation for a reason. I was indeed ready for independent research and to carve my path outside of the lab.

**My "job mode on" switch didn't really activate until I took my advisor's advice to start getting organized**: I made a spreadsheet to track places I applied to (or was going to apply to). Looking back, this making it official makes a lot of sense. We ML PhD students are used to filling up tables and feeling a sense of accomplishment from it (re: experiment tables :wink:). The sheet literally looks like this:
