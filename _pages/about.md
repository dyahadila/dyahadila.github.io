Hello! I am a PhD student at UW-Madison, advised by [Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/), and part of the [Sprocket Lab](https://sprocketlab.github.io/). I've had the opportunity to intern 2x at AWS AI Research with [Shuai Zhang](https://shuaizhang.tech/) and [Bernie Wang](https://www.mit.edu/~ywang02/). The internship [work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03631) was published at ICML 2024.

**Research Interest** My work aims to achieve the following goals:
- Developing **data and compute-efficient algorithms** for adapting LLMs and Foundation Models to specific tasks, domains, and preferences
- Building **robust and reliable models** that generalize effectively across diverse contexts and scenarios

Originally, I was from Indonesia. I enjoy reading books (fantasy, thriller, mystery, theology, investigative journalism.. almost everything really!), drawing, doing pilates, and hiking.
