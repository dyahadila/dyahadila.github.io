Hello! I am currently a PhD student at UW-Madison, advised by [Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). 

I am broadly interested in how to build efficient machine learning (ML) solutions that are robust and reliable. Recently, my focus has been on improving the reliability of large multi-modal (vision-language) model. I'm especially interested in developing methods that relies less on labeled data.

Originally, I came from Indonesia and finished my undergrad at NTU Singapore. In my free time, I enjoy reading books (fantasy, thriller, non-fiction.. almost anything really!) and swimming in nature.
