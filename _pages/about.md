Hello! I am currently a PhD student at UW-Madison, advised by [Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). 

I am broadly interested in how to build efficient machine learning (ML) solutions that are robust and reliable. I am also interested in exploring the rationales behind ML failure modes (e.g., distribution shift, capturing long-term dependency structure, etc.)

During my master's at the University of Minnesota, I was fortunate to be advised by [Ju Sun](https://sunju.org/). I also worked closely with [Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/) and with [Shashi Shekhar](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~shekhar/).

Originally, I came from Indonesia and finished my undergrad at NTU Singapore. In my free time, I enjoy reading investigative journalism books and swimming in nature.
