Hello! I am currently a PhD student at UW-Madison Department of Computer Science, advised by Professor [Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). 

I am broadly interested in how to build efficient machine learning solutions that are robust and reliable. I am also interested in exploring the rationales behind machine learning failure modes (e.g., distribution shift, OOD detection, etc.)

During my master's at the University of Minnesota, I was fortunate to be advised by  Professor [Ju Sun](https://sunju.org/). I also worked closely with Professor [Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/) and with Professor [Shashi Shekhar](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~shekhar/).

Originally, I came from Indonesia and finished my undergrad at NTU Singapore. In my free time, I enjoy reading investigative journalism books. I also enjoy swimming in nature.
