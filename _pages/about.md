Hello! I am a PhD student at UW-Madison, advised by [Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). I've had the opportunity to intern 2x at Amazon AWS AI Research, collaborating with [Shuai Zhang](https://shuaizhang.tech/) and [Bernie Wang](https://www.mit.edu/~ywang02/). [Our work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03631) during the internship was published at ICML 2024.


**Research Interest**developing robust and efficient machine learning systems, with an emphasis on reducing data and compute costs. Lately, Recently, I've been working on fast and cheap LLM alignment and robustifying foundation models. In the past, I have worked on weak supervision and also on OOD detection.

Originally, I was from Indonesia. I enjoy reading books (fantasy, thriller, mystery, theology, investigative journalism.. almost everything really!), drawing, doing pilates, and hiking.
