Hello! I am a PhD student advised by [Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/) in the [Sprocket Lab](https://sprocketlab.github.io/). 

I’ve been fortunate to intern at Google Research, collaborating with Hanna Mazzawi, [Benoit Dherin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4LtcTR8AAAAJ&hl=en), and [Xavi Gonzalvo](https://xavigonzalvo.github.io/) as well as at AWS AI Labs.

**Research Interest.** My work focuses on:
- Developing **data and compute-efficient algorithms** for adapting LLMs to specific tasks and preferences
- Building **robust and reliable models** that generalize across diverse scenarios
- Exploring LLM **latent representations** to uncover emergent patterns and deeper insights into their internal mechanisms

:star2: <span style="color:#d633ff;"> **I’m currently on the job market for industry roles starting in 2026.**</span> Always happy to chat about research scientist or engineer opportunities!
