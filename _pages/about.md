Hello! I am currently a PhD student at UW-Madison Department of Computer Science, advised by [Professor Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). 

I am broadly interested in how to build efficient machine learning solutions that are robust and reliable. I am also interested in exploring the rationales behind machine learning failure modes (e.g., distribution shift, OOD detection, etc.)

During my master's at the University of Minnesota, I was fortunate to work with Professor [Ju Sun](https://sunju.org/) in developing a machine learning system for disease detection. I also worked closely with Professor [Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/) in understanding OOD detection in NLP and with Professor [Shashi Shekhar](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~shekhar/) in anomaly detection in spatio-temporal data.

Originally, I came from Indonesia (yes, I swim at sea a lot. no, this is not a stereotype) and finished my undergrad at NTU Singapore.
