Hello! I am a PhD student at UW-Madison, advised by [Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). This past Fall, I completed an internship with Amazon AWS AI research group with [Shuai Zhang](https://shuaizhang.tech/) led by (Bernie Wang)[https://www.mit.edu/~ywang02/] and [George Karypis](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/george-karypis).

**Research Interest** I'm interested in building robust and reliable machine learning (ML) solutions, especially in settings where access to labeled data is limited. Recently, I've been focusing on robustifying foundation models (both multi-modal and language models). I have worked on weak supervision -- mainly in improving weak sources coverage and mitigating their biases; and also on OOD detection -- to understand the characteristics of OOD samples.

Originally, I was from Indonesia and finished my undergrad at NTU Singapore. In my free time, I enjoy reading books (fantasy, thriller, mystery, theology investigative journalism.. almost everything really!), drawing, doing pilates, and hiking.
